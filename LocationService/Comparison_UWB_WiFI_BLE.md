UWB vs BT/Wifi

UWB funciona midiendo el tiempo de retorno de la señal (timeof flight) que da una mejor precision que BT

UWB mejora la penetración en diferentes materiales

UWB genera menos interferencias

UWB tiene menos dispositivos compatibles

BLE beacons have 70mtrs sending signal

BLE pricing is lower 

BLE is widespread in mobile phones

BLE has an already hudge infrastructure deployed

UWB is ment for both data and location while BT is ment for data and is used for location

UWB has major advantages in any environment where so called multipath effects,n Bluetooth 5.1, phase measurements of several receiver antennas can overlay due to reflections, which will result in inaccurate or even impossible measurements.



## other libraries / open source projects

Find3 already seen have pasive, active possitioning, have a server to put wherever you want, use the bt of your mobile (4.0/5.0/5.1)

(https://github.com/neXenio/BLE-Indoor-Positioning) only active, need an external api for the acces to bt

indoor location is an opensource framework that uses mapwize to show the results, have several implementations

where am I uses wifi signals but only implemented for desktop/laptop devices



For ultrawave band 

poly point has both BLE and UWB but uses some propietary boards but there is a huge posibility to be implemented with of the self devices

newforestberlin use the same DWM1000 and impletent the system mainly done to find the raspy but with litraletarization and python can be used the other way arround to search for the anchors instead

cheekiang uses the same DWM1000 as the other
